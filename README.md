~~stops traverse cut warr tank spam in TERA - module for proxy~~

~~commands: (in proxy channel)~~
          ~~tcblock - turns module on or off (on by default, mild mode)~~
          ~~tcfull - turns agressive mode on or off ~~
         
~~mild mode - shows the 13th stack of tc buff, blocks some of the spam~~
~~agressive mode - blocks ALL tc buffs~~
